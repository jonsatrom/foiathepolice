Civil Asset Forfeiture
----------------------

A field guide to exposing a secret police budget using public records requests.

Overview 
--------

This field guide has written to serve as a historical record about _how_ we investigated the previously undisclosed program of Civil Asset Forfeiture in Chicago. Along the way we found many frustrations and had to think creatively about how to find information. This field guide was written with that goal in mind. We hope you are inspired by our previous work and can reproduce our work in your own jurisdiction(s). You will undoubtably run into your own frustrations; if we can help please reach out to us `info@lucyparsonslabs.com`. 

 .. note:: A note about our style guide -- you will see us use the generic "we" to denote anyone who helped our project. This is not to claim credit for anyone's work, a full list of contributors can be found in the Acknowledgement section, however much of the work was done by Lucy Parsons Labs with support from journalists, editors, lawyers and the community. It would be very difficult to give precise credit for such a long, large and overlapping project; for these reasons we use the _pluralis modestiae_ "we". 
 
 What is Civil Asset Forfeiture?
--------------------------------

Civil Asset Forfeiture is a process by which the government can seize assets that are suspected of being tied to crimes. This could include currency (U.S.C.) in the form of cash or pre-paid debit cards, electronics, cars and other tangible assets. There are various statues that oversee asset forfeiture including local laws, federal laws and State laws. Since this is a civil matter and not a criminal matter, the State is not required to provide legal representation as in criminal trials. Often times the standards for evidence are much lower than reasonable doubt. Additionally, the sixth amendment protections for a "speedy trial" also does not hold. The end result is that -- in the rare cases where an individual's property is returned to them -- it could be months or even years between seizure and return.

Ground Rules for FOIA
---------------------

We used the Illinois version of the Freedom of Information Act (also called FOIA) to make public records requests over two years. Since every State has different public records requests laws, it is useful to enumerate the highlights of the Illinois statue. 

 * You don't have to give your name in order to file a FOIA request in IL
 * You do not have to live in IL to file a FOIA request.
 * You can send a FOIA in person, by mail, by fax or by email.
 * The Agency you send a FOIA to has 5 business days to acknowledge it. They may take an additional 5 days by sending a written letter of extension. 
 	* An agency that does not acknowledge your request within 5 business days can not claim it is "unduly burdensome" after that time
 * If you request too many records, an agency can claim that a request is "unduly burdensome". For example, a prisoner requests all police misconduct files ever created in Chicago. CPD does not respond in 5 business days so then they can not claim this if they are sued under the FOIA statue. (This actually happened)
 *  An agency can call you a recurrent requestor if you send too many FOIAs within too short of a time. This does not apply to journalists, non-profits, or academics.
